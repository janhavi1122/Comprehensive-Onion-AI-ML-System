# OnionAI-ML-System

**An advanced, modular AI/ML platform for precision onion cultivation and management**

---

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive AI/ML system tailored for onion farming, integrating multiple interactive modules covering key aspects such as:

- Price prediction using LSTM time-series models  
- Quality grading via YOLOv8 instance segmentation  
- Multiclass onion leaf disease detection combining YOLOv8 and EfficientNetB3 CNN  
- Yield forecasting based on environmental inputs  
- Storage spoilage risk assessment using heuristic methods  
- Additional modules including seed production optimization, hydroponic growth monitoring, weed detection, disease outbreak forecasting, harvest scheduling, and spoilage risk prediction (working placeholders)

The system is accessible through a user-friendly **Streamlit** web application with an intuitive interface designed to support precision onion cultivation with real-time agronomic insights.
